## TODO

- when landing a shot in the top row going through all the neighboring cells is not working correctly. At the moment for example the bot shoots 9 and then jumps to 0
- I think the bot only places boats vertically
- check when misfiring on the first shot that next shot is neighboring cell for the original landed shot
